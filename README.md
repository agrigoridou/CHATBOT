# CHATBOT_01

This is an intelligent chatbot built with Python. It uses:
- TensorFlow/Keras neural network for intent classification
- spaCy for semantic similarity (understands similar phrases, not just exact matches)
- Flask to provide a web-based interface

Features:
- Responds to greetings, questions, and common requests
- Fallback to semantic similarity if confidence is low
- Easy to extend with new intents and responses
